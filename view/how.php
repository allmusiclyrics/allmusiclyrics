<br><br>If you want to find out what songs are playing there are two app options I have used for the past <?php echo (date('Y')-2008);?> years to identify music playing during shows, movies, commercials and even in the real world! (such as radio or shops, etc)

Apps:

<li><a href="http://shazam.com" target="_blank">Shazam</a></li>
<br><br>
Website:
<li><a href="http://www.tunefind.com" target="_blank">TuneFind</a></li>
<br><br>
Both work with Android and iPhone/iOS so give them a try and help us update our database!
