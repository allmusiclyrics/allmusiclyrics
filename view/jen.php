	Dear Jenifer,<br>
	I already expressed how much you mean to me. What I had done in the past is inexcusable.<br>
	I already expressed how much I want to make it up to you. I want to be the most improved Boris.<br>
	Our past is what makes us so great because we both grown and learned together.<br>
	I have already proved how much you mean to me and how much I want to make it up to you. <br>
	I always loved you and wanted the best for you, I also want to do better because of my past actions.<br>
	I know what you feel about the past but trust me that I learned from my mistakes.<br>
	I know how you feel about the future but trust me I learned from the past.<br>

	Dear Jen,<br>
	I love you. You mean the world to me. 
		<br>
		Love is new to me. I'm lost without you, It is hard for me to really express how you make me feel.<br>
		I am truly sorry for how I acted, there's no excuse and there is no way that I can make it up to you, maybe it is the way I was.
		<br>I hope you can forgive me over time.<br>
		I hope to still talk to you and see you if you can find it in you and allow that to happen.<br>
		We are at different places in life at this stage, I understand why you have to move on for now, I just hope to not lose you out of my life because you mean so much.<br>
		I guess I need to learn more and grow before we can consider something more than friends.
		<br> I really hope you appreciate what I had done for you and what I went through in order to be with you for the time we were together, I can appreciate what you did for me and how much you loved, cared and taught me over this past year we were together.<br>
		We both have many similarities but yet so incredibly different; emotionally, physically, mentally, etc.
		<br>
		We both have much to go in this life to get to where we are going.<br>
		Our views, goals and aspirations are different, from life and relationship.
		<br><br>
		You know me better than anyone on this planet.<br>
		I don't know what else to say right now, I hope you have a good Easter (or whatever you say).
